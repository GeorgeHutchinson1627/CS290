My five websites that I like/dislike would be the youtube, wikipedia, moodle, reddit and twitter. 

https://www.youtube.com/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
https://moodle.linnbenton.edu
https://www.reddit.com/
https://twitter.com/

What I like about youtubes homepage is that new random recommended videos are always easy to find and you can also see which channels you are subscribed to fairly easily, 
but I also think that the homepage could use a little more color in it's design.

wikipedia's design is simple and because it is an encyclopedia there is going to be walls of text, which can be hard to navigate but it's not really the websites fault. I also like
hope accessing the sources are pretty easy using a hyperlink.

Moodle however, is a atrocious website that constanly logs you out after a short period of time, and also crashes more than it should. The design is also kind of dull, and the weekly 
messeges are often out of date.

Reddit I think has a pretty decent design, I like the community based interaction to find the stuff that you want, and reddit also has an easier that average way to delete your account
and posts if you so wish. I also appreciate the dark mode as it is easier on the eyes. 

for twitter I think the interactiviy is good, but the most annoying thing is the ad's which appear with an clickbait image and try to disguse themselves as posts from real people.
Like youtube I also think that twitter could use some more color.
