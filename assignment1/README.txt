For my webpage I want to make a type of chat service that allows anybody with the ability to access the chat to talk to each other is a large group chat. 
I would intend for there to be a way to login with a name (though I doubt I will be able to get anykind of user account authentication) and 
I hope to have a button that exits the chat. In order for users to chat with each other I will need some way to get user input and display it on a page. 
Otherwise I think formatting everything to look nice will also be important so that it looks polished but being new to html and such I am unsure on how to acomplish that.
